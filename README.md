# Implemented Type Inference

Type inference is tough - really tough!  It is so easy to get properly confused and lost.  This repo is my type inference scratch pad where I try out different implementations in different languages for different constructs.

Essentially all implementations are [Hindley-Milner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindleyâ€“Milner_type_system) based and then seeded from the implementation described in https://github.com/sdiehl/write-you-a-haskell.
