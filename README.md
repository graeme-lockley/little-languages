# Implemented Type Inference

Type inference is tough - really tough! It is so easy to get properly confused
and lost. This repo is my type inference scratch pad where I try out different
implementations in different languages for different constructs.

Essentially all implementations are
[Hindley-Milner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindleyâ€“Milner_type_system) based
and then seeded from the implementation described in
https://github.com/sdiehl/write-you-a-haskell.

## STLC - Simple Typed Lambda Calculus

STLC is a small language helpful in getting the type inference engine working without the clutter of complexity.
